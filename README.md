# Parking-Management-System
The Parking Management System is a application designed to manage the records of incoming and outgoing vehicles in a parking facility. The goal is to track the entry and exit of cars, monitor the current occupancy, determine if the parking lot is full, and calculate parking fees based on the duration of stay.This system uses number plate recognition to manage vehicles efficiently. It keeps a record of when vehicles come and go, maintains a list of parked cars, and calculates the cost for each vehicle based on how long they stay.
